# I Did It

I Did It - a simple and fun activity tracker.

Add activities you want to complete each day and enjoy the great feeling of swiping it off when you do! 

For each task you swipe: 
  - up for 'yes'
  - down for 'no'
  - right for 'almost'
  - left for 'skip'.
  
The app is beautiful, fun and breeze to use!
